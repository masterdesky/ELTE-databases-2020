    "\n",
    "## A Quick Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin searching SkyServer, you should get a quick introduction what it means to search for data. SkyServer's information on all sky objects - stars, galaxies, and others - is stored in a database, a storehouse for data. A request to a database to return some information is called a query. When you ask a database for information, you must write your query in some computer language that the database can understand. SkyServer, like many other databases, uses Structured Query Language (SQL). When you write a query with SQL, the database searches for all records that meet your search criteria; in the case of SkyServer, each record is the information on a single observation of a single object in the sky.\n",
    "\n",
    "But you have to be careful when you write a query: since the database contains hundreds of pieces of information for each of millions of objects, a poorly written query could return Gigabytes of information that won't help you at all. The best possible query will return all the information that you need, and no information that you don't need. Writing queries is an art - before you start writing, you need to think carefully about what information you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Database Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "To know what information you need, you need to know exactly what information the database contains. The SkyServer database is divided into a series of tables. Each table contains data of a different type. For example, all data related to an object's spectrum are stored in a table called specObjAll. All data related to an object's image properties are stored in a table called photoObjAll. SkyServer contains many tables, although most of the commonly accessed data are stored in just three or four of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each table contains a series of data columns. A column contains only one type of data - for example, magnitude or sky position. Each record consists of a series of columns, although some columns may be empty for some records. Some tables contain only two or three columns; some contain hundreds! Knowing exactly which table and which column contains the data you want can be a challenge.\n",

Click on any of the table names to be taken to a list of the most commonly used columns in that table. Take some time to understand what these columns mean, because you will use them over and over again in your queries. Click on a table (or view) name in the list below to launch a popup window showing the most commonly-searched data columns in that table/view.\n",
    "\n",
    "[PhotoObj](http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr16/en/help/howto/search/photoobj.html) - stores information about the images of every object, including run, rerun, camcol, field, ra, dec, magnitudes and object flags.\n",
    "\n",
    "[PlateX](http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr16/en/help/howto/search/platex.html) - stores information on the aluminum plates that the SDSS uses to take spectra, including their exposure times and reddening information. You will need to find the Plate and MJD in this table to look up an object's spectrum in the Get Spectra tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "[SpecObj](http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr16/en/help/howto/search/specobj.html) - stores information on objects' spectra, including redshifts and spectroscopic classifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, SkyServer contains several subsets of the PhotoObj table. PhotoPrimary contains only the \"best\" measurements of each object. Generally, it's better to use PhotoPrimary rather than PhotoObj, which contains both good and bad data. Star contains only data for stars, Galaxy contains only data for galaxies, and Unknown contains only data for objects classified as \"unknown.\" These subsets are actually views rather than tables; you will learn the difference later in the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Other Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "First, SkyServer's Query tool is limited to 90 seconds of search time and 100,000 results. If you want to write queries that return more than 100,000 objects, you have to be clever: split your query into multiple pieces. For example, if you are looking for stars between ra = 0 and ra = 3, you could write two queries, one from ra = 0 to ra = 1.5 and one from ra = 1.5 to ra = 3. Save all the results of the queries until you have all the results you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, you can get around the limit completely writing your query in [CasJobs](http://casjobs.sdss.org/casjobs/), which has no limits on search time or number of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want the query to return fewer results, you can add the statement \"top n\" to the select block, where n is some integer from 1 to 1,000. For example, when you're testing to see if a query returns reasonable results, you might not want to have to wade through 1,000 records. You might want to have the query return 10 records instead; use \"select top 10\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, SQL is not case-sensitive, meaning capital and lowercase letters are the same. The commands \"select,\" \"Select,\" \"SELECT\" will all do the same thing. But, it's a good idea to use capitalization and spacing to make your queries as easy as possible for other people to understand.\n"

After the ON, specify the name of the column you want to use to do the join, both in the base table and in the table you want to join. The column may be called something different in the two tables, so study the Schema Browser carefully. For example, so temporarily join the photoObj and specObj views, you would say:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, it doesn't matter what order the two tables appear in.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, look at the following query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT top 100\n",
    "    x.plate, x.mjd, \n",
    "    s.fiberID, \n",

    "    s.z, p.ObjID\n",
    "FROM photoObj p\n",
    "JOIN specObj s ON s.bestObjID = p.objID\n",
    "JOIN plateX x ON x.plateID = s.plateID          \n",

    "    s.class = 'qso' \n",
    "    and s.zWarning = 0 \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As this query demonstrates, you don't have to join all tables on to the base table - you can join tables onto other join-ed tables as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "To join two tables, look for common entries - when the same column appears in both tables. The columns that appear after the ON keyword, connected by an equals sign, will be the names of the same column in each table.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find columns to use in joining tables, look in the [Schema Browser](http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr16/en/help/browser/browser.aspx). Find places where the same column name appears in more than one table. You can use that column in the where block to join the tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naming tables in the SELECT and WHERE blocks — either by their full name or by the nickname you specify — is important because sometimes columns in different tables have the same name, yet contain different data. For example, the PhotoObj table contains the right ascension and declination of the object in the \"ra\" and \"dec\" columns. The PlateX table also has ra and dec columns, but these are the ra and dec of the telescope while it is observing a single plate, not the ra and dec of an individual object on the plate. So photoObj.ra and plate.ra mean totally different things!\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the join statements, the query above includes two other commands in the where block. The command specObj.class = 'qso' tells the query to return quasars only, and the command specObj.zWarning = 0 tells the query to return only objects for which we have well-measured redshifts. Again, you can add more restrictions to your query in terms of colors, magnitudes, ra and dec or any number of parameters.\n",

One easy way to answer this question would be to retrieve those plates ordered by the [Modified Julian date (MJD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day#Variants) on which they were observed, in order from the first date to the last date. SQL's ORDER BY command will sort records in ascending order according to a specified column.\n",

    "\n",
    "To look at a few plates - in this case, just the ones numbered 275 or less - in order of observation date - use the ORDER BY command. The syntax of ORDER BY is simple: just type \"order by\" followed by the name of the data column by which you want to sort. If you want the data sorted in descending order, from most to least, add \"desc\" to the end of the command.\n",

    "### Flags and Photo Flag Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "For every object identified in an image, the SDSS stores a set of flags, yes/no data telling whether some attribute is true for that object. Flags are available for objects too close to the edge of a frame, for objects whose images were saturated (so bright that some light was not detected), or for objects with some pixels not detected by the camera.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flags are stored in the flags column of the PhotoObj table (and its related views). Take a moment to look in the [Schema Browser](http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr16/en/help/browser/browser.aspx) to learn what the photo flags are. Then, search for photo flags with the command \"select flags from photoObj\". What do you get?\n",
    "\n",
    "You get nothing but a long, confusing number! Each object in the PhotoObj table may have many true/false flags associated with it. To save memory, the flags are not stored as true/false lists, but as components of a long number - each flag is stored as a specific value at a specific position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, while this technique may save memory, it makes the flags impossible for humans to understand. Fortunately, SkyServer includes a function, fPhotoFlagsN, to translate photo flags from confusing numbers into English names.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for calling a function in SQL is to type \"dbo.\" - the letters dbo and a period - in front of the function name. Then type the name, then enclose the function's\n",
    "input(s) in parentheses. The function fPhotoFlagsN takes one input, and it is (almost) always the flags column of the PhotoObj table. So the syntax for calling the function would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "dbo.fPhotoFlagsN(flags)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might want to find English names for flags of all stars around the point 175,1. The query would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    p.objID, p.flags, dbo.fPhotoFlagsN(p.flags)\n",
    "FROM photoObj p\n",
    "JOIN dbo.fGetNearbyObjEq(140,20,5) n ON n.objID = p.objID\n",
    "WHERE\n",
    "    p.type = 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The query returns flags as both numbers and names. You can see that the names are much easier to understand!\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, instead of looking at all flags for many objects, you might want to select only objects that meet certain flags. In other words, you might want to use a flag as part of a where block. Unfortunately, fPhotoFlagsN can't search for a flag - it can only list flags that are present for a certain object. Fortunately, SkyServer includes another function that can help you search for flags - the similarly named fPhotoFlags.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how fPhotoFlags works, remember that a flag is a true/false statement. If a flag is true, it will have some positive value, which will depend on the flag. But if the flag is false, its value will be zero, and always zero. So to find out if a flag is true for a given object, just compare its value to zero. If the flag's value is greater than zero, the flag is true; if the flag's value is equal to zero, it is false.\n",

    "\n",
    "But remember that fPhotoFlags only translates the name of the flag from computer-speak to English. To actually check the value of the flag, you still need to search the flags column of the photoObj table. To search records for the presence of an English-language flag using fPhotoFlags, you need to use an ampersand (&). The syntax is \"where (flags & dbo.fPhotoFlags(name)) \\[> or =\\] 0\". So to search for all unsaturated objects near the point (175,1), you would use the following query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    p.objID, p.ra, p.dec, dbo.fPhotoFlagsN(p.flags)\n",
    "FROM photoObj p\n",
    "JOIN dbo.fGetNearbyObjEq(140,20,5) n ON n.objID = p.objID\n",
    "WHERE\n",
    "    (p.flags & dbo.fPhotoFlags('SATURATED')) = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to enclose the name of the flag in single quotes. The equals sign means you are searching for objects with the SATURATED flag set to false. To search for saturated objects instead, change \"=0\" to \"> 0\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize the difference between fPhotoFlagsN and fPhotoFlags, use fPhotoFlagsN in the select block to view a record's flags in English. Use fPhotoFlags in the where block, with an & sign, to search all records for a specific flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "To search a different area of the sky, just change the ra and dec inputs to fGetNearbyObjEq. SkyServer also includes a similar function called f.GetNearestObjEq that returns only the object nearest to the coordinates you entered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Try It!\n",
    "\n",
    "Try out the following queries.\n",
    "\n",

Click on 5-10 cluster galaxies and save them in your online notebook. Open the notebook, and look for features that the cluster galaxies have in common. Guess the center position and radius of the galaxies. Then, write a query that uses what you have learned to search for cluster galaxies."

    "What percentage of galaxies have spectral redshifts measured? What percentage have photometric redshifts taken? What are the advantages of using photometric redshift? Try to compare photometric and spectral redshift; how accurate are photometric redshifts? Use *PhotoObjAll*, *SpecObjAll* and *PhotoZ* tables to answer these questions. Don't forget to filter only for galaxies.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Challenge 3. \n",
    "Look at colors and spectra of stars, and find stars consistent with white dwarfs. Create a list of white dwarfs in the SDSS database. Use the *PhotoObjAll* table to get color indices (difference of neighbouring magnitudes, u-g, g-r, r-i, i-z), where you should apply the following conditions: u-g < 0.4, g-r < 0.7, r-i > 0.4 and i-z > 0.4. \n",

    "What are the largest galaxies in the SDSS, in terms of size?\n",
    "HINT: Look at surface brightness and ellipticity. Use the *PhotoObjAll* table and investigate the petrosian radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 5. \n",
    "Find all objects with spectra classified as unknown. Use the *PhotoObjAll* table and filter for the *type* field.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 6. \n",
    "Find the broad absorption line (BAL) quasars in the SDSS database. At what redshifts are most BAL quasars found? Use the *ancillary_target1* field of the *SpecObjAll* table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 7. \n",
    "Find variable stars in the SDSS (stars imaged more than once whose magnitudes changed by more than 0.1 between observations). How variable are the stars? To search for objects with multiple observations you can find [here](http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr8/en/help/cooking/stars/morethanonce2.asp) some help."
